        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            I am a Software Engineer specializing in backend development with 5 years of experience. My primary stack
            revolves around JavaScript in the Node.js environment with TypeScript, enabling me to build robust solutions
            that meet the expectations of the products I currently work on.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, I am advancing my skills by taking the 'JavaScript Expert' course by Erick Wendel and studying
            English at BRASAS, where I am on the sixth book of a 10-level course..
          </p>
          <p>
            I am comfortable working with both relational and non-relational databases, as well as cloud platforms such
            as AWS, Azure, and GCP. Additionally, I collaborate on frontend solutions, whether using a framework like
            ReactJS or working with templates like Blade.
          </p>
          <p>
            I enjoy embracing challenges and strive to maintain a continuous evolution in the technologies I use on a
            daily basis, always allowing myself to understand what is happening in the tech landscape to stay informed
            about the latest developments.
          </p>
          <p>
            My goal is to contribute as a backend or full-stack developer in a company that uses technology to solve
            problems efficiently and easily for its customers.

          <h3>Software Engineer</h3>
          <span class="location">Audima, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil</span>
          <span>Sep 2019-Present</span>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Development of the backend for an application that runs directly on client pages accessed by thousands of
              users daily, following the principles of Clean Architecture and Test-Driven Development (TDD) using Jest.
              Technologies include Node.js, TypeScript, Redis for caching, MariaDB, and artificial intelligence services
              from major cloud platforms. This enables different profile types based on the client.
            </li>
            <li>
              Development of an API receiving thousands of requests per minute for storing and updating statistical
              data, built with Node.js using Express and MongoDB.
            </li>
            <li>
              Complete restructuring of an application where directors and employees retrieve statistical usage data for
              all company products. The query process was reduced from 5 minutes to an average of 20 seconds using
              Laravel and MongoDB.
            </li>
            <li>
              Creation of the development environment for applications with Docker and Docker Compose, allowing newly
              hired developers to run and test applications on the same day they arrive, thanks to the simplicity
              offered by containers.
            </li>
            <li>
              Restructuring and configuration of a queue processing an average of 50 requests per second, reducing job
              failures from 8% to 2%, using Laravel and Beanstalkd.
            </li>
            <li>
              Implementation of artificial intelligence services from major cloud platforms such as Amazon Web Services
              (AWS), Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP), bringing greater innovation to the products.
