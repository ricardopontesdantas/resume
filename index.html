        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            I am a Software Engineer specializing in backend development with 5 years of experience. My primary stack
            revolves around JavaScript in the Node.js environment with TypeScript, enabling me to build robust solutions
            that meet the expectations of the products I currently work on.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, I am deepening my knowledge of algorithms, data structures, and automated testing, while
            continuing my English studies at BRASAS, where I am on the sixth book of a 10-level course.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am comfortable working with both relational and non-relational databases, as well as cloud platforms such
            as AWS, Azure, and GCP. Additionally, I collaborate on frontend solutions, whether using a framework like
            ReactJS or working with templates like Blade.
          </p>
          <p>
            I enjoy embracing challenges and strive to maintain a continuous evolution in the technologies I use on a
            daily basis, always allowing myself to understand what is happening in the tech landscape to stay informed
            about the latest developments.
          </p>
          <p>
            My goal is to contribute as a backend or full-stack developer in a company that uses technology to solve
            problems efficiently and easily for its customers.

          <h3>Software Engineer</h3>
          <span class="location">Audima, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil</span>
          <span>Sep 2019-Present</span>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Development of the backend for an application that runs directly on client pages accessed by thousands of
              users daily, following the principles of Clean Architecture and Test-Driven Development (TDD) using Jest.
              Technologies include Node.js, TypeScript, Redis for caching, MariaDB, and artificial intelligence services
              from major cloud platforms. This enables different profile types based on the client.
            </li>
            <li>
              Development of an API receiving thousands of requests per minute for storing and updating statistical
              data, built with Node.js using Express and MongoDB.
            </li>
            <li>
              Complete restructuring of an application where directors and employees retrieve statistical usage data for
              all company products. The query process was reduced from 5 minutes to an average of 20 seconds using
              Laravel and MongoDB.
            </li>
            <li>
              Creation of the development environment for applications with Docker and Docker Compose, allowing newly
              hired developers to run and test applications on the same day they arrive, thanks to the simplicity
              offered by containers.
            </li>
            <li>
              Restructuring and configuration of a queue processing an average of 50 requests per second, reducing job
              failures from 8% to 2%, using Laravel and Beanstalkd.
            </li>
            <li>
              Implementation of artificial intelligence services from major cloud platforms such as Amazon Web Services
              (AWS), Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP), bringing greater innovation to the products.
            </li>
            <li>
              Leadership of a development team, ensuring best practices and code quality standards, as well as assisting
              in planning and implementing complex technical solutions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Development of a caching strategy to reduce the number of requests and associated costs when consuming
              external APIs, using Node.js, Express, and Redis, increasing system efficiency.
            </li>
            <li>
              Creation of an API that streams voice for an accessibility product, using Node.js with Express and Azure
              services, enabling the reading aloud of web page content.
            </li>
            <li>
              Development of a CRON job managing stored objects based on predefined business rules, using Laravel and
              MongoDB.
            </li>
            <li>
              Implementation of a custom audio generation system for varied content, using Laravel and Azure services
              for the automatic creation of high-quality audio files.
            </li>
            <li>
              Implementation of a CRON job that collects and aggregates statistical data, displayed in card format in
              the client's admin panel, providing insights into product usage, using Laravel and MongoDB.
            </li>
            <li>
              Analysis and creation of table structures for a project using the MariaDB database, ensuring database
              integrity and performance.
            </li>
            <li>
              Planning and execution of a full migration of storage objects between different cloud platforms, with
              associated record updates in MongoDB, ensuring a seamless transition without data loss.
            </li>
            <li>
              Creation of custom audio players with JavaScript, SCSS, and Webpack, where HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are
              managed and optimized by Webpack to ensure better performance and flexibility.
